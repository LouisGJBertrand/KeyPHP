KeyPHP

KeyPHP is a framework used to create terminal tools
algorithm using php vanilla classes.

You can import libraries like stdio to make an
Algorithm that suits the best to your needs

Developing libraries for KeyPHP is really easy and
importing them is not much complicated.

Although there is only 2 libraries that comes with
Keyphp:

	- « base » : a required library for key php that
	permettes to include libraries more easily, that
	provides classes to identify the app and more. its
	automatically imported to your project

	- « STDio » : a class that comes with the bundle.
	This library helps the programmer to make an
	interface between the user and the programme.

KeyPHP is an open source project under MIT
License And libraries can be share freely on the
internet.

In order to start your algorithm, you only have to type

	php ENV.php
