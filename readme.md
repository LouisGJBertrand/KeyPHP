![alt text](https://github.com/PYLOTT/KeyPHP/blob/master/ressources/keyphp%20logo%20transp%20256x1.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

KeyPHP is a framework used to create terminal tools<br>
algorithm using php vanilla classes.<br>
<br>
You can import libraries like stdio to make an<br>
Algorithm that suits the best to your needs<br>
<br>
Developing libraries for KeyPHP is really easy and<br>
importing them is not much complicated.<br>
<br>
Although there is only 2 libraries that comes with<br>
Keyphp:<br>
<br>
	- « base » : a required library for key php that<br>
	permettes to include libraries more easily, that<br>
	provides classes to identify the app and more. its<br>
	automatically imported to your project<br>
<br>
	- « STDio » : a class that comes with the bundle.<br>
	This library helps the programmer to make an<br>
	interface between the user and the programme.<br>
<br>
KeyPHP is an open source project under MIT License<br>
And libraries can be share freely on the internet.<br>
<br>
In order to start your algorithm, you only have to type<br>
<br>
```bash
php ENV.php
```

# Change Log:

```
	V1.1.0

	- Debug masks
	- Debug state switch (boolean)
	- Json files for Env setup and App setup
	- Better Libraries
	- /!\ compatibility issues can be observed with the
	previous release. /!\
	: started->Ui Assisted Tool In QT
	: started->Official KeyPHP Library Repo
	: started->Project Terminal Assistant Tool
	: System rewrite

	V1.0.0.BETA
	- system core creation
	- library imports
	- application informations
```

# Todo:

	- terminal tool to:<br>
		- easily modify the application informations<br>
		- to compile the algorithm into an executable<br>
	- a debug feature<br>
	- a complete documentation for basic functions<br>
	- register the framework to multiple databases<br>
	- an UI assistant tool to create libraries<br>
