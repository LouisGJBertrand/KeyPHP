algorithm using php vanilla classes.<br>
<br>
You can import libraries like stdio to make an<br>
Algorithm that suits the best to your needs<br>
<br>
Developing libraries for KeyPHP is really easy and<br>
importing them is not much complicated.<br>
<br>
Although there is only 2 libraries that comes with<br>

<br>
# Todo:<br>
<br>
	- terminal tool to:<br>
		- import libraries coming from the internet<br>
		- easily modify the application informations<br>
		- to compile the algorithm into an executable<br>
