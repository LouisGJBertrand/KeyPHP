---------- 1. Structure ----------

Every Library must follow this basic structure:

    - folder with the indicative name of the library:
        - a library loader file named either:
            - <the name of the class>.php,
            - loader.php,
            - as your wish but you must set the 'loaderFileName' Value
            in infos.ini or infos.json
        - an infos.ini or infos.json containing every infos

the rest of the library must be included in the library folder
but the developer can organize it the way he wants (except for
files explained earlier).

Your infos.ini file must include:

    [infos]
    name=                  ;library name
    infos=                 ;library infos
    version=               ;library version
    author=                ;library author
    packageID=             ;library package ID
    loaderFileName=        ;(Optional Value)

Your infos.json file must include:

    {
        "infos":
        {
            "name":"",
            "infos":"",
            "version":"",
            "authors":
            [
                ""
            ],
            "packageID":"",
            "loaderFileName":""
        }
    }

you can refer to the example section of the doc to understand
the different aspects of the infos.ini

The "library named".php file can contain what you want, but it's
preferred to import classes with this file instead of declaring
classes into it.

------------ Examples ------------

library folder example:

    (for library "base")
    base/
    - links/,
      - BaseLibTester.php,
      - KEYPHPAPPLICATION.php,
      - PHPLibraryImport.php,
      - PHPWebAppInfosHolder.php
    - base.php,
    - infos.ini

    (for library "STD-I/O")
    stdio/
    - links/,
      - stdio.php
    - stdio.php,
    - infos.ini

example of "library named".php file:

    (for library "STD-I/O")
    // STD-I/O Class

    // Optional library used to communicate with the user
    // KeyPHP Implementation by Louis Bertrand <adressepro111@pylott.yt>

    if (!class_exists("stdio")) {
        require_once("links/stdio.php");
    }

info.ini example :

(for library "base")
[infos]
name=base library                                   ;library name
infos=required library for keyphp                   ;library infos
version=1.0.0                                       ;library version
author=Louis Bertrand <adressepro111@pylott.yt>     ;library author
packageID=yt.pylott.keyphp.base                     ;library package ID
